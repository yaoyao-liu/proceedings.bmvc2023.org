Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used tool for diagnosing and monitor- ing these conditions, but the interpretation of MRI data can be challenging and time- consuming, particularly for large datasets. For this reason, there is a growing interest in developing automatic methods to detect anatomical landmarks in brain MRI data to quantify such dysmorphologies and obtain brain biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of these disorders. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two brain landmark- ing architectures based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN): an ensemble of single-landmark models, and a multi-landmark model. Both approaches are compared on MRI scans of healthy and Down syndrome subjects. The proposed pipeline comprises several steps: i) the preprocessing of the MRI data, involving registration to a common anatomical space, ii) the automatic extraction of the Mid-Sagittal Plane (MSP) of the brain, based on a multi-scale search algorithm, and iii) the training and evaluation of the DCNN models to detect 8 anatomical landmarks on the MSP. Our results indicate that i) the ensemble of single-landmark models is more accurate, achieving average landmark- ing errors lower than 2mm in healthy subjects, and ii) landmarking error is higher in Down syndrome individuals, which suggests that brain dysmorphologies associated with certain disorders require training specific models for accurate landmarking.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmvc2022.mpi-inf.mpg.de/BMVC2023/0754_video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Malé_2023_BMVC,
