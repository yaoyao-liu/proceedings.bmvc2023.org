The facial region covers the lip region and furthermore reflects more speech-related attributes obviously, which is beneficial for AVSE. 
%
However, besides the above speech-related attributes, there also exist some static and dynamic speech-unrelated attributes which always cause speech-unrelated appearance changes in the speaking process.
%
To address these challenges, we propose a dual attention cooperative framework to fully capture speech-related information with facial cues and dynamically integrate such information with the audio signal for AVSE. 
%
Specifically, to capture and enhance the visual speech information beyond the lip region, we propose a spatial attention based visual branch to introduce the global facial context for robust visual feature extraction.
% 
Secondly, we introduce a dynamic visual feature fusion strategy by incorporating a temporal-dimensional self-attention module for fusion of the visual feature, which enables the model to robustly handle facial variations in the process.
% 
Thirdly, the acoustic noise in the speaking process is always not a stable constant noise, which makes the speech quality in the contaminated audio signal varied in the process. Therefore, we also introduce a dynamic fusion strategy for the audio feature. 
%
By integrating the cooperative dual attention reflected in both the visual branch and the audio-visual fusion strategy, our model can effectively extract beneficial speech information from both audio and visual cues for AVSE.
%
We performed a thorough analysis and comparison on different datasets with several settings, including the normal case and hard case when visual information is unreliable or even absent. 
%
These results consistently show that our model outperforms existing methods under multiple metrics.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Wang_2023_BMVC,
