However, deploying such models on edge devices with limited memory and computing power remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel knowledge distillation approach called Feature-level Relationship-based Knowledge Distillation (FLRKD). The proposed approach employs image quality similarity assessment to distill knowledge from a pre-trained model into smaller models that are suitable for deployment on edge devices. FLRKD utilizes peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) between feature maps of different hidden layers as relational knowledge to enhance the classification accuracy of student models. Moreover, the proposed approach includes an effective loss function that accelerates the convergence of the knowledge distillation algorithm. Additionally, a regressor is introduced to address the issue of inconsistent feature map spatial size between teacher and student models in heterogeneous scenarios. Comparative and ablation experiments demonstrate the superiority of FLRKD over mainstream knowledge distillation methods in terms of higher classification accuracy (up to 4%) and faster convergence rates. Notably, the proposed approach achieves significant improvement in classification accuracy (up to 3%) even in heterogeneous scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmvc2023.mpi-inf.mpg.de/0360_video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{An_2023_BMVC,
