However, as an inductive method, MAML is unable to fully utilize the information of query set, limiting its potential of gaining higher generality. 
To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method that generates pseudo-labels adaptively and could boost the performance of the MAML family. The proposed methods, dubbed Generative Pseudo-label based MAML (GP-MAML), GP-ANIL and GP-BOIL (when combined with MAML, ANIL and GP-BOIL respectively), leverage statistics of the query set to improve the performance on new tasks. Specifically, we adaptively add pseudo labels and pick samples from the query set, then re-train the model using the picked query samples together with the support set. The GP series can also use information from the pseudo query set to re-train the network during the meta-testing. While some transductive methods, such as Transductive Propagation Network (TPN),  struggle to achieve this goal. Experiments show that all our methods, GP-MAML, GP-ANIL and GP-BOIL, can boost the performance of the corresponding model considerably, and achieve competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Liu_2023_BMVC,
