However, there are various methods to improve their efficiency.
Two such methods are quantization, a well-known approach for network compression, and re-parametrization, an emerging technique designed to improve model performance.
Although both techniques have been studied individually, there has been limited research on their simultaneous application. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach called RepQ, which applies quantization to re-parametrized networks.
Our method is based on the insight that the test stage weights of an arbitrary re-parametrized layer can be presented as a differentiable function of trainable parameters. We enable quantization-aware training by applying quantization on top of this function. RepQ generalizes well to various re-parametrized models and outperforms the baseline method LSQ quantization scheme in all experiments.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Prutianova_2023_BMVC,
