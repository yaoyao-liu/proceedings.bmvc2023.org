In this paper, we aim to extend its capabilities to the pixel level to achieve audio-visual segmentation (AVS). Specifically, we explore the following question: how can the instance-level alignment knowledge gained from contrastive pre-training benefit pixel-level audio-visual segmentation? To address this question, we approach the problem from two perspectives in AVS: a supervised setting and a zero-shot setting. In the supervised setting, we enhance the instance-level AudioCLIP model by incorporating a pixel-wise multi-modal fusion module. This leads to a simple yet effective model AC-FPN that enables pixel-level predictions for sounding objects, following the standard AVS training fashion. On the other hand, in the zero-shot setting, we further investigate the feasibility of promoting the Segment-Anything-Model (SAM) for AVS by proposing three prompt formulizing strategies based on instance-level contrastive pre-training models. Experimental results on both subtasks demonstrate the potential of leveraging instance-level contrastive pre-training for advancing audio-visual segmentation to the pixel level.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Yu_2023_BMVC,
